# Linear and Logistic Regression with Scikit Learn 
This Repository contains three Jupyter Files.
## Note Book-1 
In this notebook, I will perform the following tasks to solve a machine learning problem by applying the linear regression with Sciket Learn

* Downloading and exploring the DME Insurance Inc dataset for machine learning 
* Linear regression with one variable using Scikit-learn
* Linear regression with multiple variables
* Using categorical features for machine learning
* Regression coefficient and feature importance
* Other models and techniques for regression using Scikit-learn

## Note Book-2
In this notebook, I will perform the following tasks to solve a machine learning problem by applying the logistic regression with Sciket Learn

* Download Rain in Australia dataset from Kaggle
* Exploratory data analysis and visualization
* Splitting a dataset into training, validation and test sets
* Imputing missing values in numeric columns
* Scaling numeric features to a (0,1) range
* Encoding categorical columns as one-hot vectors
* Training a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn
* Evaluating a model using validation set and test set
* Saving a model to disk and loading it back

## Note Book-3 
In this notebook, I will perform House Price Prediction with Linear Regression. I will follow these steps to train the model.

* Download and Explore the Data
